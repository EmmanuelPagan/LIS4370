#The R code that is being used is essentially an unshortened version of myMean <- mean(assignment2) and fully utilizes the function argument, the first line sets up the 
function to be paired with the object "assignment2" while the second line assigns the function to give the mean with dividing the sum and the length of "assignment2" 
giving the result on line 7, 19.25.
